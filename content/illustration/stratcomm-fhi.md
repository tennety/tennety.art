## Description

[Link to project](https://www.stratcomm.in/projects/RCCE-package-for-targeting-key-population-and-PLHIV)

This project consisted of several kinds of digital material designed to reach key populations of people living with HIV in India, including transgender and homosexual communities, that are at increased risk from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as social stigma.

Working from briefs developed by [StratComm](https://www.stratcomm.in/who-we-are), I illustrated low resolution GIFs for use with WhatsApp to high-resolution video-ready slides. Use the slide navigation to see more examples!
