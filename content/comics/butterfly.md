## Description
I drew this as part of a local comic art show at [Wild Goose
Creative](https://wildgoosecreative.com) called _Comics vs Art IV: The Gods Have
Spoken_. The theme of the show was to re-interpret as comics well-known
works of art that represented religious/spiritual iconography.

This piece was based on Ike no Taiga's famous painting _Dreaming of a
Butterfly_, which in turn was an interpretation of [this
passage](https://ctext.org/zhuangzi/adjustment-of-controversies#n2732) from
the writings of Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi.

I hadn't heard of Zhuangzi or the numerous pieces of art inspired by its
"Butterfly Dream" passage, and the idea of the subjectivity of reality and
dreams struck me. I tried to capture the vividness of a dream so immersive as
to cause the dreamer&mdash;is it the butterfly? or the person?&mdash;to forgo their
"real" identity. I chose the white butterfly because of its presence in
Japanese folklore, and because the original artist (Ike no Taiga) was from
Japan.
