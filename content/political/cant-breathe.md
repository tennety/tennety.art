This past week has been profoundly disturbing, even for this dumpster fire of a year. This piece is the start of a series unlike anything I've done before, and a channel for the pain and anger and powerlessness seething in me. If this piece resonates with you, and you would like to share it, I ask that you donate to one of the following organizations:

* [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)
* [The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/)
* [Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org/)
* [George Floyd Memorial Fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/georgefloyd)
